Digital Twin - Unity3D + Flask Integration

This demonstrates a real-time **Digital Twin** simulation using 
**Unity 3D** for 3D visualization and **Flask (Python)** as a backend REST API. 
It shows how room-level data such as temperature, occupancy, electricity usage, 
and HVAC status can be simulated.
